# This diagram was designed using PlantUML and will render a .png file on the PlantUML Web Server here: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000
# This will render a simple workflow for a basic healthcare monitoring application. It will outline a rudimentary architecture that can be edited as necessary.
# This diagram is from the perspective of the end user accessing the application from the on premise infrastructure.
